** DO NOT COMMIT THIS INTO REPO **

To commit some changes and update versioning on Bower and npm,

1) Commit your changes
2) Manually update version number in package.json
3) Add an entry in CHANGELOG.md
4) Create release commit with changes of 2 and 3
5) Tag the release with version (git tag vx.y.z) (Yes, "v" must be part of the tag)
6) Push the commit and tags (git push origin master && git push --tags)
7) Notify npm (npm publish)
